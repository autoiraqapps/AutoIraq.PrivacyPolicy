    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <!-- Paste your long privacy policy content here -->
    <p>
      Welcome to AutoIraq, a platform designed to empower individuals to list, discover, and purchase vehicles in a streamlined and user-friendly manner. This Privacy Policy describes how AutoIraq Technologies (“AutoIraq,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, discloses, stores, and safeguards your personal information in connection with your use of our mobile application, website, and related services (collectively, the “Services”).
This Policy applies to all users, including buyers, sellers, and visitors. By accessing or using the Services, you consent to the data practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use immediately.

    </p>

    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>
      We may collect the following categories of personal and non-personal information including information you provide directly such as registration data when creating an account, which may include your full name, email address, phone number, password, and an optional profile picture. This also includes data you input when listing a vehicle for sale, such as make, model, year, price, location, photos, and any description you provide. Additionally, we may collect the content of messages sent between users, call metadata including duration and timestamps, as well as feedback, reviews, and support requests. 
      While AutoIraq does not currently process payments within the app, in the future we may allow secure payment options and collect billing and transactional information.
    </p>

 <p><strong>1.1 Information Collected Automatically</strong></p>
<p>
  We collect device data such as device type, manufacturer, operating system, and unique device identifiers like IMEI or MAC address. We also gather usage data including pages or screens viewed, time spent on the app, interactions with features, crash logs, search queries, and referral sources. With your consent, we collect location data such as GPS or approximate location to help show local listings and optimize app features. Additionally, we use cookies, beacons, and various analytics tools to improve usability and personalize the content you see.
</p>

 <p><strong>1.2  Information From Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>
  If you sign in through Google, Apple, or Facebook, we may receive basic profile information and your email address. We may also receive demographic or interest data from advertising partners to personalize your ad experiences. Additionally, certain technical information may be shared with our service providers and vendors to support security, analytics, and hosting of our platform.

</p>


    <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <p>
      Your data enables us to facilitate secure transactions, allow user communication, personalize experiences, and improve our services. We may use anonymized data for analytics to improve platform performance.
    </p>

     <p><strong>2.1  To Provide the Core Service</strong></p>
<p>
  We use the information we collect to facilitate the listing, browsing, and searching of vehicles by analyzing your preferences and recent activity. For example, we may store your recently searched vehicles and use that data to recommend similar listings that match your interests and tastes. This helps enhance your browsing experience by surfacing more relevant options. We also enable direct communication between buyers and sellers through in-app messaging or shared contact details, allowing smoother negotiation and faster responses. Additionally, we manage your user account and preferences, including saved searches, notification settings, and any personalized filters, to ensure the platform works seamlessly and intuitively based on your individual usage.
</p>

   <p><strong>2.2  To Improve and Enhance Our Platform</strong></p>
<p>
  We monitor app performance and user behavior to guide ongoing product development and improve the overall user experience. This includes collecting data on how features are used, how users navigate the app, and where potential issues may arise. We conduct internal testing and debugging using this information to identify bugs, optimize performance, and ensure that new updates function correctly before being released. Additionally, we perform analytics to measure the effectiveness of specific features and gauge overall user satisfaction. This helps us make informed decisions about which features to improve, remove, or expand, ensuring that AutoIraq continues to meet the needs and expectations of our users.
</p>

   <p><strong>2.3  To Ensure Safety and Legal Compliance</strong></p>
<p>
  We use certain information to verify user identities and prevent fraudulent activity on the platform, ensuring a safe and trustworthy environment for all users. This includes monitoring for suspicious behavior, validating account details, and implementing security measures to protect both buyers and sellers. We actively detect, prevent, and address abuse, spam, and any form of illegal transactions to maintain the integrity of our services. Additionally, we may be required to respond to legal requests, such as subpoenas, court orders, or other lawful demands from regulatory authorities, in compliance with applicable laws and to protect the rights, safety, and property of our users and the company.
</p>

  <p><strong>2.4  To Communicate With You</strong></p>
<p>
 We use your information to send important transactional updates, such as notifications about new messages, activity alerts related to your listings or account, and confirmations of changes you’ve made within the app. Additionally, we may deliver newsletters, promotional content, and product announcements to keep you informed about new features, special offers, or updates to our services. From time to time, we may also conduct user surveys or request feedback to better understand your experience and improve the app. Participation in promotional communications or surveys is entirely optional, and opt-out options are always provided in accordance with your communication preferences.
</p>

  <p><strong>2.5  For Marketing and Advertising (with consent)</strong></p>
<p>
 We use your information to send important transactional updates, such as notifications about new messages, activity alerts related to your listings or account, and confirmations of changes you’ve made within the app. Additionally, we may deliver newsletters, promotional content, and product announcements to keep you informed about new features, special offers, or updates to our services. From time to time, we may also conduct user surveys or request feedback to better understand your experience and improve the app. Participation in promotional communications or surveys is entirely optional, and opt-out options are always provided in accordance with your communication preferences.
</p>


    <h3>3. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h3>
    <p>
      We never sell your data. We only share information when necessary for functionality (e.g., displaying your listing) or when required by law. Third-party services we use comply with privacy laws and handle data responsibly.
    </p>

     <p><strong>3.1  User-to-User Visibility</strong></p>
<p>
 Public profile information, vehicle listings, and communication tools you use within the app may be visible to other users as necessary for the proper functioning of the platform. This includes displaying your name, profile picture, and the details of any vehicles you choose to list, such as descriptions, pricing, and photos. Communication features like messaging or calling are provided to facilitate interaction between buyers and sellers, and visibility of this data is essential to support those connections. We ensure that only the relevant information required for meaningful and secure transactions is shared, and we do not expose private data beyond what is needed to operate the core features of AutoIraq.
</p>

  <p><strong>3.2  Third-Party Service Providers</strong></p>
<p>
We rely on trusted third-party service providers to support various aspects of our platform’s functionality and infrastructure. This includes cloud storage and hosting solutions such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud, which securely store user data, media uploads, and ensure high availability of our services. For analytics and performance monitoring, we use tools like Firebase and Sentry to collect insights on app usage, identify bugs, and enhance the overall experience. Communication services such as Twilio and SendGrid are used to facilitate secure messaging, phone verification, email notifications, and transactional updates. Additionally, we utilize customer support platforms like Intercom and Zendesk to manage user inquiries, provide real-time assistance, and ensure that support requests are handled efficiently. All of these third-party providers are carefully selected and operate under strict data protection agreements to ensure your information is securely processed and used solely for the purposes outlined in this policy.
</p>

 <p><strong>3.3  Legal and Regulatory Requirements</strong></p>
<p>
We may disclose your personal information to law enforcement agencies, government authorities, or legal counsel when required to do so by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request. This includes complying with subpoenas, court orders, or other legal obligations. Additionally, we may share information when we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of AutoIraq, our users, or the general public. Such disclosures are made with careful consideration and only to the extent legally permitted or necessary to address fraud, security concerns, potential violations of our terms, or other unlawful activities.
</p>

<p><strong>3.4  Corporate Events</strong></p>
<p>
In the event that AutoIraq is involved in a business transition such as a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal data may be transferred or disclosed as part of the evaluation process or the resulting transaction. Such data transfers are a standard part of corporate transactions and are carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your information continues to be protected in line with this Privacy Policy, and we will provide notice if your personal data becomes subject to a different privacy policy as a result of the transaction.
</p>

    <h3>4. Data Storage and Retention</h3>
    <p>
      Your personal information is stored securely on servers housed within state-of-the-art data centers that implement multiple layers of physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or disclosure. These safeguards include, but are not limited to, controlled access to facilities, encryption of data both at rest and in transit, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits to ensure ongoing protection.

We retain your personal data only for as long as your account is active or as necessary to provide you with the full range of services offered through AutoIraq. This retention period also covers fulfilling legal and regulatory requirements, addressing any disputes or claims, enforcing our terms and agreements, and maintaining operational continuity. For example, if you deactivate your account, certain data may still be retained for a legally mandated duration or for legitimate business purposes, such as fraud prevention and recordkeeping.
<p>
When your information is no longer needed for these purposes, we employ secure and irreversible methods to delete, destroy, or anonymize your data, making it impossible to associate with you personally. Our data retention policy is regularly reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with applicable laws and best practices in data privacy and security. We are committed to maintaining your trust by treating your personal data with the utmost care throughout its lifecycle, from collection to eventual disposal.
</p>

    </p>

    <h3>5. Data Security Measures</h3>
    <p>
     We employ multiple layers of advanced security measures to protect your personal data at every stage of its processing. All data transmitted between your device and our servers is secured using HTTPS with SSL/TLS encryption, ensuring that your information remains confidential and protected from interception during transfer. Sensitive data stored on our servers is encrypted using strong AES-256 encryption standards, providing robust protection against unauthorized access. Our infrastructure is further safeguarded by firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and strict access controls to prevent and detect any malicious activity or breaches. To maintain the highest level of security, we regularly conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, identifying and addressing potential weaknesses before they can be exploited. Access to personal data within our organization is restricted through role-based access controls, ensuring that only authorized personnel who require the information to perform their duties can view or handle your data. Together, these measures demonstrate our commitment to maintaining a secure environment for your personal information and upholding your privacy. You have the right to access, update, or delete your personal data at any time. To request this, contact us at <strong>AutoIraqapps@gmail.com</strong>.
   <p>
    Despite these efforts, no system is 100% secure. Please protect your login credentials and notify us immediately of any unauthorized activity.

   </p>
    </p>

    <h3>6. Your Privacy Rights</h3>
    <p>
      Since AutoIraq serves users globally, your data privacy rights may vary depending on your country or region’s applicable data protection laws. Many jurisdictions grant users important rights regarding their personal information. These rights commonly include the ability to access the personal data we hold about you, allowing you to request a copy of that information for your review. You may also have the right to request corrections or updates to ensure your data remains accurate and complete. In many regions, you can request the deletion of your account and associated personal data, subject to legal or operational limitations. Additionally, data portability rights often enable you to receive your personal data in a commonly used, machine-readable format, empowering you to transfer your information elsewhere if you wish. 
      <p>
        You may also have the right to object to or restrict certain types of data processing, especially those related to direct marketing or processing based on legitimate interests. Furthermore, if you have given consent for marketing communications or specific features, you can withdraw that consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of prior processing. Because data privacy regulations differ worldwide, we encourage you to contact our privacy team for detailed information about your rights based on your location and to exercise these rights accordingly.
      </p>
      
<p>
    To exercise any of these rights, contact us at <strong>autoiraq.apps@gmail.com</strong>. We may require verification of identity before processing your request.

</p>

    </p>

    <h3>7. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
    <p>
     In the AutoIraq app, cookies and similar technologies function to improve your overall user experience and support essential features. These tools enable the app to remember your login status so you can stay signed in between sessions without needing to repeatedly enter your credentials. They also store your personalized settings such as language preferences, display options, and other customization choices to ensure the app behaves consistently according to your preferences every time you use it. Additionally, cookies help us collect anonymous data about how you navigate the app—like which pages you visit, how long you spend on certain screens, and how you interact with listings or messaging features. This information is used to analyze app performance and user behavior so we can identify bugs, optimize features, and introduce improvements that make buying and selling vehicles smoother and more enjoyable. Furthermore, with your consent, cookies enable us to deliver targeted advertisements relevant to your interests, improving the relevance of marketing messages you receive. You have full control over cookie settings and can adjust or disable them in the app’s privacy or settings section at any time.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>
     AutoIraq is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or 16 in jurisdictions with stricter laws). We do not knowingly collect data from minors. If we learn we have inadvertently collected such data, we will delete it promptly.
    </p>

     <h3>9.  International Data Transfers</h3>
    <p>
      AutoIraq operates as a global platform, serving users from various countries and regions around the world. As part of providing and maintaining our services, your personal information may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of your home jurisdiction, including countries within the European Union and other locations where our service providers, partners, or affiliated entities operate. 
      <p>
      These countries may have data protection laws that differ from those in your country, but we are committed to ensuring that your information is handled securely and in compliance with applicable privacy regulations.

To safeguard your data during international transfers, we implement robust legal and technical measures. This includes the use of standard contractual clauses approved by regulatory authorities, data processing agreements, and other binding commitments that require all parties receiving your data to protect it with the same high standards we maintain. 
</p>
We also conduct regular assessments to ensure that our data processors and partners adhere to these privacy and security requirements.

By transferring your information internationally under these safeguards, we aim to maintain the privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of your data while enabling the seamless operation and improvement of our services worldwide. If you have any questions or concerns about how your data is transferred or protected, please contact our privacy team for more detailed information and assistance.


</p>

    <h3>10. Third-Party Links and Services</h3>
    <p>
      Our app may include links to third-party websites, applications, or services that are not operated or controlled by AutoIraq. These external sites and apps have their own privacy practices, terms of use, and data handling policies, which may differ significantly from ours. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for the content, privacy protections, or security measures of these third-party platforms. When you choose to access or interact with these external websites or applications through links provided within our app, we strongly encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies and terms of service before sharing any personal information or engaging in any activities. It is important to understand how those third parties collect, use, and protect your data, as AutoIraq has no control over their operations and is not liable for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of their services. Your continued use of our app implies acceptance of these terms regarding third-party links.

    </p>

    
    <h3>11.  Data Breach Protocol</h3>
    <p>
      In the unlikely event that a data breach occurs involving your personal information, AutoIraq is committed to responding swiftly and effectively to protect your data and minimize any potential harm. Our first priority will be to promptly investigate the nature and scope of the breach in order to contain it and prevent any further unauthorized access or disclosure. Once the incident is thoroughly assessed, we will notify all affected users in a timely manner, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, providing clear information about the breach and the steps we are taking to address it. Additionally, we will fully cooperate with relevant regulatory authorities and data protection agencies to ensure transparency and compliance throughout the investigation process. 
      <p>
      To prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we will implement robust remedial measures, including enhancing our security infrastructure, updating internal policies, and providing additional staff training on data protection best practices. Our goal is to safeguard your personal information and maintain your trust by handling any data breach with the utmost seriousness and diligence.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>12. Automated Decision Making</h3>
    <p>
     Currently, AutoIraq does not use automated decision-making processes that produce legal effects or similarly significant impacts on users. This means that decisions affecting your account, listings, or access to services are made with human oversight and judgment. However, as our platform evolves, we may implement automated tools to improve safety and efficiency, such as auto-flagging potentially fraudulent listings or suspicious activity. In such cases, we will inform you clearly about these processes and provide you with options to opt out where possible or to request a review by a human to ensure fairness and accuracy. Your rights and preferences regarding automated decisions will always be respected in accordance with applicable laws.
    </p>



    
    <h3>13.  Policy Changes
</h3>
    <p>
      We may update or revise this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or improvements to our services. When significant changes are made that materially affect how we collect, use, or share your personal information, we will notify you in a timely manner through one or more communication channels such as email, in-app notifications, or prominent announcements on our website. It is important that you review these updates carefully. Your continued use of AutoIraq’s Services after the effective date of any revised Privacy Policy constitutes your acknowledgment and acceptance of the updated terms. If you do not agree with any changes, you should discontinue using the Services and contact us to address any concerns you may have. We encourage you to periodically check this policy to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.
    </p>
